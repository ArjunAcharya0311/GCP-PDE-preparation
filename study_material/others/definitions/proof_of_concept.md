# Proof of Concept

- A proof of concept (POC) is an exercise in which work is focused on determining whether an idea can be turned into a reality. A proof of concept is meant to determine the feasibility of the idea or to verify that the idea will function as envisioned.
- A proof of concept is not intended to explore market demand for the idea, nor is it intended to determine the best production process.
- It's focus is to test whether the idea is viable -- giving those involved in the proof-of-concept exercise the opportunity to explore the idea's potential to be developed or built.
- In software development, for example, a proof of concept would show whether an idea is feasible from a technology standpoint. For startups, a proof of concept would demonstrate financial viability.

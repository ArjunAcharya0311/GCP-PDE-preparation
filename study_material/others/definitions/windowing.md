## Windowing
Windowing is the process of taking a small subset of a larger dataset, for processing and analysis. A naive approach, the rectangular window, involves simply truncating the dataset before and after the window, while not modifying the contents of the window at all.

## Window functions or Analytic functions
- Analytic functions are those which compute values over groups of rows, returning a single result for each of the rows.
- This is like the annotate function in django.

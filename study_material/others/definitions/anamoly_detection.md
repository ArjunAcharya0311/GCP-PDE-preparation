# Anomaly Detection
- Anomaly detection (or outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.
- Anomalous activities can be linked to some kind of problems or rare events such as bank fraud, medical problems, structural defects, malfunctioning equipment etc.

### Assumptions for the anomaly detection
- The dataset used for the learning purpose is assumed to have all non-anomalous training examples (or very very small fraction of anomalous examples), i.e. **Anomalies only occur very rarely in the data**.
- Their features differ from the normal instances significantly.

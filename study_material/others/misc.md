### How to measure the reliability of a system
Mean time between failure is used for measuring reliability.

### What is used to dsitribute workload?
A global load balancer is needed to distribute workload across multiple regions.

### When to use L1 and L2 regularization?
Use L1 regularization when you need to assign greater importance to more influential features. It shrinks less important feature to 0.
L2 regularization performs better when all input features influence the output & all with the weights are of equal size.

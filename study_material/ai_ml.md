## Machine Learning
- Types
	- Supervised learning: 
		- Labels are provided. 
		- Types - 
			- Regression - Output predictions are continuous in nature. For ex, predicting out the price of a house which can lie in any range of numbers. Some regression ML algorithms are - 
				- Linear Regression
				- Support Vector Regression(SVR)
				- Decision Tree Regressor
			- Classification - Output predictions are discrete in nature. For ex, sentiment analysis which can be positive or negative. Some classification algorithms are - 
				- Logistic Regression
				- Support Vector Machine(SVM)
				- Decision Tree Classification
	- Unsupervised learning: 
		- Labels are not provided. 
		- Find structure within the data
		- Clustering is unsupervised learning

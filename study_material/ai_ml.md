## Machine Learning
- Types
	- Supervised learning: 
		- Labels are provided. 
		- Types - 
			- Regression - Output predictions are continuous in nature. For ex, predicting out the price of a house which can lie in any range of numbers. Some regression ML algorithms are - 
				- Linear Regression: 
					- Random fact - Linear regression can be done on ordinary CPU's whereas Neural Networks(Feed Forward or Recurrent) require resource intensive machines(i.e GPU's) whereas 
				- Support Vector Regression(SVR)
				- Decision Tree Regressor
			- Classification - Output predictions are discrete in nature. For ex, sentiment analysis which can be positive or negative. Some classification algorithms are - 
				- Logistic Regression
				- Support Vector Machine(SVM)
				- Decision Tree Classification
	- Unsupervised learning: 
		- Labels are not provided. 
		- Find structure within the data
		- [Clustering](https://github.com/singhgautam7/GCP-PDE-preparation---GRS/blob/main/study_material/others/definitions/clustering.md) is unsupervised learning

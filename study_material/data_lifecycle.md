# Data lifecycle
(Docs [link](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/data-lifecycle-cloud-platform))
The data lifecycle has four steps.
-   **Ingest**: The first stage is to pull in the raw data, such as streaming data from devices, on-premises batch data, app logs, or mobile-app user events and analytics.
-   **Store**: After the data has been retrieved, it needs to be stored in a format that is durable and can be easily accessed.
-   **Process and analyze**: In this stage, the data is transformed from raw form into actionable information.
-   **Explore and visualize**: The final stage is to convert the results of the analysis into a format that is easy to draw insights from and to share with colleagues and peers.
